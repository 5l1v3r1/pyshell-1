PyShell - Command Line Classes for Python
=========================================

This is a class-based command-line interface system. Using object-inheritance (my favorite thing, but maybe not yours), this module provides structure for command-line tools and configurable objects. 

Contents:

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 2
    
    base
    subcommand
    config
    loggers
    util
    postmortem
    pipeline


Examples:

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 2
    
    examples/cliengine
